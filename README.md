This course offers a basic introduction to programming with focus on graphics, sound and interaction. The programming framework is p5. Students gain fundamental programming skills and reflect on the usage of software in a creative context.

## Learning Objectives

With this course, you will gain

* an understanding of programming,
* **skills to develop simple programs from scratch**,
    * Knowledge about resources
    * Guidance towards and learning through self-studies,
* skills to apply programming as (an expressive) tool.

## Topics

Class topics can be divided into what you learn about programming itself and its *syntax* and what you do with your newly developed programming skill, meaning its application.

In regard to programming itself, we will cover:

* Commands, variables
* Events
* Conditions
* Loops
* Arrays
* Functions

We apply these programming skills to implement:

* Drawing, colors
* Interaction
* Movement / Animation
* Text and Typography
* Image, video
* Sound
  

Please note that topics are subject to change during the term!


## Time and Place

* Tuesdays, starting at 11:00, online
    * How long class time is, will vary from week to week.
* 1 ECTS: Attendance of >= 7 lectures
* \+ 2 ECTS: Handing in >= 7 of the exercises, passing 5 of them
* \+ 1-3 ECTS: For a practical final project, the ECTS depend on the size of the project

## Grading

* Leistungsnachweis ‘mit Erfolg’
* Optional 'Benoteter Leistungsnachweis' based on final project.


## Materials & Assignments

We will use two environments in this course: one where you can read the sessions and scripts (GitHub) and one, where you can access code examples and upload your assignments (OpenProcessing).

[GitHub](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/lecture_introduction_to_coding)

* [Follow this link to the folder.](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/lecture_introduction_to_coding)
* This site is read-only for you.
* Here you find the scripts and session summaries.
    * [Sessions](01_sessions) (= week) summarize all topics, links and exercises for that session.
    * [Scripts](02_scripts) are based on topics and updated through out the course. Sessions link to the relevant scripts.
* The material for the day is usually uploaded before class.
* After class a video recoding of that session is linked in the session summary.

[OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/)

* [Follow this link to the class.](https://www.openprocessing.org/class/64768)(Code: 296C39).
    * You must create an account and sign up to the class.
* Here we do all the coding and exchange practical exercises.

## Deadlines

It is indicated for each session when the assignment is due. The deadline for the final project is March, 15th.

The deadline for the assignments are soft, the one for the final project is hard. This means that I am flexible with the weekly assignment deadlines. I do highly recommend to work on the assignments weekly and to hand them in by the given deadline but the world doesn't end if you don't. I rather have you completing all assignments and maybe handing in one late, than skipping an assignment. However, the deadline for the final project is strict and I do not accept late submissions. If you are sick you have to give me a doctor's note for an extension.
