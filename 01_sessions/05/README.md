## Script

* [Script 07 - Arrays](../../02_scripts/itc_ws2021_07_arrays_script.md)

## Assignment

To be added...


<!-- ### 05.01 Arrays

Reflect on your previous code submissions: was there anything that you couldn't do because you didn't know about arrays yet? If so, extend a previous code submission to using arrays and re-submit.



## 05.02 A Jumping Game - First Steps

Over the next couple of assignments, we are going to implement step by step a simple "Jumping Game". 

## 05.02.01 First Steps

Look at [this example](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/1024625) for a simple game and think about how the underlying code could look like. What variables and functions are needed?

## 01.02 First Steps
Go through [this tutorial](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/1035400) to structure the code and create the jumping functionality.

## 01.03 Double Jump
Right now the player can basically fly through jumping again and again. The game would be quite easy like this. Adapt the code so it allows no more than one extra jump mid air.
