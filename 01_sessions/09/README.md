# Session 09 - Jumping Game Step 08 - Game States

Go over the solution from the class, which adds an enemy, stops the flying and adds sound and understand it well. Add these aspects also to your solution or start with the [given solution](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/1066944).

## Assignment

The following tasks is intentionally without any step by step instructions but it is up to you to look up the needed functionality for text and to figure out the steps to take. If you get stuck feel free to get in touch with me via email any time.

### 09.01 Jumping Game - Counting Coins

The goal of this task is to display the number of coins selected as text on the screen. For that

* add a variable that counts the number of coins selected so far by the player,
* look up how to add [text](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/text) ([reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Typography), [examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)) to a canvas, and
* display that number as text on the screen, e.g. in the upper left corner.

### 09.02 Jumping Game - Game Over

Create some logic that sets the game to a *game over* state at some point. Whether this is after one collision with the enemy or after a number of collisions is up to you to decide. It is also up to you what should happen then. You could stop the game and display text or also even just restart the game.
