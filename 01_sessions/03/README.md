# Session 03 - Variables

## Learning Objectives


With this session you 

* understand how to work with data, and
* understand what the scope of a variable is, and
* how animate certain properties, such as color and position.

## Assignment

### 03.01 Basic Animation

For this assignment, start with [03.06 - The Color Spectrum - Step 04](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/1024185#).

Now, we want to animate the movement of the circle. Meaning, the circle should move on its own and not follow the mouse anymore.

The result should look somewhat like the following:

The steps to animate the position of the circle are similar to the steps we made for animating the color.

1. We need two new variables for both coordinate in x and y, e.g. `positionX`, `positionY`.
2. With each `draw()` call increase the value `positionX`, `positionY`.
     * For that add two new variables `stepX`, `stepY`
3. Setup up conditions to check for the boundaries of the sketch canvas.
    * You get the canvas size with the system variable `width` and `height` 
    * If it is moving out of the canvas, letâ€™s switch direction.


### 03.02 Advanced Improvements

1. Randomize the step value, so that every time we start the program, we get a different animation.
    * Do this in `setup()`.
    * Assign a random value within a suitable range to `stepX`, `stepY` each.
2. For a more precise boundary check, check the "collisions" with the sketch window limits not with the center of the circle, as it is now, but incorporate the radius of the circle into the check. Then the circle will bounce off its sides and not slightly move out of the window anymore.
