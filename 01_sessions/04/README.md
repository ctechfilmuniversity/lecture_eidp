## Assignment


### 04.01 Grid Pattern

Write a sketch that generates a pattern with a similar logic as the 10 PRINT example. Your pattern should follow an element-by-element and row-by-row iterative creation process. You can use the code from the script as basis.  

The overall goal is to create a visual pleasing or interesting pattern up to your liking.  


### 04.02 Interactive Parameters

Make your pattern interactive by mapping at least two changeable visual characteristics to, e.g., the mouse and / or keys.
